<ul>
    <li>My best skill is reconciliation and managing the work environment. I tend to shift the focus away from complaints and problems and try to get everyone to focus on the main problem/objective. I tend to be flexible and adapt to needs, as well as being very understanding. I'm very disciplined and committed to my responsibilities, which is why I take on few so as not to be overwhelmed. Although I'm shy, I'm very communicative. I also have skills such as proactivity, attentiveness and agility.</li>
